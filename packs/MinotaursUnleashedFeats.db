While many ally themselves with the Demon Lord of minotaurs Baphomet, many have turned their back on the demon lord and seek a better path</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>In life, Baphomet was a mortal minotaur who guided his people from out of the Labyrinths underneath Iblydos and across the world before becoming a demon lord in death. While not all know this tale, many fear minotaurs across Golarion, seeing them as fearsome hunters of the Labyrinths across the world to be slain. However the truth is that countless minotaurs have sought a different path in the many years since Baphomet freed their people and in time, have developed diverse and unique cultures all their own. If you want to play a character that is as sharp and perceptive as they are strong and proud, you should play a minotaur</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy contests of strength and displays of physique.</li>\n<li>Appreciate a good puzzle or test of wit</li>\n<li>Strive to prove yourself to your community or to the world at large</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are violent or lack restraint.</li>\n<li>Find your natural sense of direction and cunning mind to be unexpectedly sharp</li>\n<li>Respect your physical strength and courage</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Minotaurs vary depending on their environment but many stand about 7 feet tall on average and have sturdy, muscular builds, hooved legs and a long bovine tail. All minotaurs grow horns atop their head although some are broader or stronger depending on their heritage. While it is an uncommon sight, hornless minotaurs do exist, though most hornless minotaurs chose to trim their horns rather than being born without. Just like regular cows, minotaur fur patterns vary wildly depending on the region and family, ranging from pure brown, to black and white spots and any other number of fur patterns that turn gray with age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Regardless of community, a belief in physical strength, courage, and religious devotion are commonly shared among the various minotaur cultures across the world, with these beliefs taking shape in many different ways. Most minotaur regardless of their culture find muscular builds attractive on any gender and their horns are seen as a sign of pride. Many preferÂ elaborate, winding, homes or complex mazes, whether natural or artificial, due to their natural sense of direction. Minotaurs also often take good care of beasts of burden, feeling a kinship with them. Those who have rejected Baphomet tend towards farming and agricultural activities in their communities rather than hunting for food or living in dungeons, but some minotaurs are drawn to dungeons, or adventuring, even without divine influence. In terms of diet, minotaur are generally vegetarians even though theyâ€™re omnivores and enjoy fresh vegetables and grains in meals. Additionally, a considerable number of minotaur societies are based near coastal regions, therefore, it is common for minotaur to be skilled seafarers by nature.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Minotaurs can usually trace their history back to the days when their people worshiped Baphomet, whether they continue to do so nowadays or not. As a result, minotaur often find themselves drawn to chaotic alignments. Some minotaurs worship Baphomet primarily, however there are a number of growing factions who worship other gods and divine forces, such as the minotaurs who live in Vudra and worship Gaelata, or the minotaurs of Iblydos who worship Iblydan hero gods. Iapholi is a particularly popular choice as many agree with her ideals and find comfort in her edicts of monstrous acceptance. Gods of the ocean such as Gozreh are also common among minotaurs, especially those who live in coastal settlements</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Minotaurs prefer names with hard consonants that make them sound strong or imposing however there are a growing number of minotaurs who have adopted the naming conventions of their new homelands and reject the old traditions, such as the minotaurs of Iblydos may name their child after heroic figures, strengths, or qualities they wish to embody. Some minotaurs choose these names for themselves as an act of independence</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Kelldar, Batek, Nagrak, Xurgrim, Sylrah, Gratio, Temachos, Faidra, Trovik, Mitevra, Vaso</p>\n<h2>Minotaur Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong>Â Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong>Â 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).
